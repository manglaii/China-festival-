                    <article>
                        <p> Pu’er Tea is a variety of fermented tea named after Pu’er, its place of origin in Yunnan Province of China in the Qing Dynasty. In fact, the so-called Pu’er Tea is a kind of tea produced in Yunnan Province of China. Leaves of Pu’er tea are thick and solid, which are derived from sundried green tea of Yunnan Daye variety. In the Qing Dynasty, Pu’er Tea was a kind of tributes, while in modern times, Pu’er Tea is popular among consumers. Pu’er is famous for its compression and lasting fragrance. Pu’er Tea is divided into loose tea and compressed tea in terms of forms. Taking sundried green tea as raw materials, compressed tea is a kind of tea in the shapes of bricks, pies, lumps or other shapes after the Pu’er Tea production process of pile fermentation, steaming and compressing, etc., which has a brown red appearance, red bright endoplasm and liquor color, unique fragrance, mellow taste and red leaves. </p> 
  <p> Yunnan Province of China is the birthplace of tea trees in the world; all kinds of tea in China and around the world mainly originated from the Pu’er Tea production area in Yunnan. Pu’er Tea has a long history. As early as the period of King Wu's conquest over Yin over three thousand years ago, Pu people in Yunnan, ancestors of tea planting, had offered tea to King Wu, but the term Pu’er Tea didn’t exist at that time. In the Yuan Dynasty, there was a place called "Buribu" which was written into Chinese characters as "Pu’er" (the spelling then was different from it is now). The term Pu’er appeared for the first time and then became famous at home and abroad. The term was changed into Pu’er Tea in the late Ming Dynasty.</p>
